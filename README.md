# Excelsior Design System

This repository contains a library of reusable code components for building New York State applications and websites. These components are built using LitElement and styled with custon CSS properties (variables) for easy customization. 

Additionally, corresponding Figma components and variables are available for prototyping.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **This code library is an early alpha phase.** It includes a limited set of components, variants, and design tokens (as custom CSS variables) and is meant to support discussions and further development. Use at your own risk.
