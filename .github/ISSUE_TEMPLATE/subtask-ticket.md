**Please answer the following:**
## Component Details
### Component API
List the props, slots, and events for each component element.
Please format as:
- propName (type) – Description (e.g. "required (boolean) – Marks field as required")
- slotName – Description
- nysCustomEventName – Description
### Functionality and behavior
Describe component behavior, edge cases, and interactions. Include any special considerations for mobile or desktop (responsiveness).
Include any min/max usage recommendations.
### Team Decisions (for NYSDS team use)
Document decisions made by the team during the proposal meeting of "to do" and "what not to do."
Example:
- Don’t show nested steps
- Only support linear flows
- Use discrete steps instead of a continuous progress bar
- Button slot sticks to the top on scroll
### Outstanding Questions
List open questions for the feedback window. These may need design input, dev review, or user research.
Example:
- Should we support optional steps that users can skip?
- Should we show descriptions under step labels?
### Comparatives / References
Link to comparable components or design systems (e.g. USWDS, Shoelace, Material, etc).
Include screenshots or internal examples when possible.
### Accessibility considerations
Include how this component interacts with assistive technologies such as keyboard navigation, screen readers, zoom magnification, and voice command. Are there audiences that might struggle with this component? How might the component become inaccessible?
### Who's involved
Please tag volunteers who may be willing to help design, develop or test this component. Note agencies that can offer significant support for the component, and tag any stakeholders. Be sure to share a list of those who helped research and prepare this proposal. Include your name and/or GitHub username if you'd like credit as a contributor.
