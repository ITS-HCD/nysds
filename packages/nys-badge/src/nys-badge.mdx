# Badge

The **`nys-badge`** component is a reusable web component that provides a visual indicator of text values like categories.

If an id is not passed, a unique id will be generated.

<div className="nys-grid-row nys-grid-gap-1">
  <nys-badge label="Stable" prefixIcon="code"></nys-badge>
  <nys-badge
    prefixIcon
    prefixLabel="WCAG 2.2"
    label="AA"
    intent="success"
  ></nys-badge>

### Icons
Badge can include icons as either a prefix or suffix. The icons can be specified using the `prefixIcon` or `suffixIcon` attributes.
