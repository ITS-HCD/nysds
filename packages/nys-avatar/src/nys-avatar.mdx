# Avatar
The **`nys-avatar`** component is a reusable web component for use in New York State digital products. It allows users to avatar an option on or off.

If an id is not passed, a unique id will be generated.

## Examples
### Images
To display an image in the avatar, set the `image` and `label` attributes. These will take priority and override initials and icons. You can also enable lazy loading for avatar images by setting the `lazy` boolean attribute.
<Canvas of={NysAvatarStories.AvatarImage} />

### Initials
If an image is unavailable, you can set the `initials` attribute to display a personalized placeholder instead of an icon.
<Canvas of={NysAvatarStories.AvatarInitials} />

### Custom Icons
When no image or initials are set, an icon will be shown. The default avatar shows an `icon` called "account_circle", but you can customize this with any other name found in `nys-icon`.
<Canvas of={NysAvatarStories.AvatarIcon} />

### Shapes
Avatars can be shaped using the shape attribute.
<Canvas of={NysAvatarStories.AvatarShapes} />

- Proper ARIA roles and attributes to ensure screen readers can interpret the avatar correctly.
- Keyboard navigation support, allowing users to avatar the avatar switch using the keyboard.
- Visual focus indicators to help users navigate the component.
