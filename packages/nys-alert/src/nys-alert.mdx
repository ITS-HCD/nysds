# Alert

The **`nys-alert`** component is a reusable web component for use in New York State digital products. It provides users with the ability to keep users informed of important and sometimes time-sensitive changes.

If an id is not passed, a unique id will be generated.

## All Alerts
Below are the available alert theme, each showcasing its unique style and purpose.

## Alert Property Examples
### Theme
Set the `theme` property to customize the alert style. Example: `theme="info"`.
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.AlertType} />

### Custom Content for Description
The `nys-alert` component supports using the `slot` feature for the alert's content. This allows you to pass in custom HTML, providing full flexibility for your alert's description.
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.DescriptionSlot} />

### Dismissible
Set a `dismissible` boolean property to add a close button in the top-right corner, allowing users to dismiss the alert.
> Additionally, the **nys-alert-closed** custom event is dispatched when the alert is dismissed. Developers can implement their own event listeners to handle custom actions, such as saving the alert's state locally. This allows for features like remembering dismissed alerts across page reloads.

### Duration
Set the `duration` property to automatically hide the alert after a specified time (in milliseconds). This is ideal for non-critical alerts that do not require user acknowledgment.

### Icon Customization
Override the default `theme` icon by setting the `icon` property to any name from the icon library.
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.CustomIcon} />

### No Icon Option
To displays an alert without an accompanying icon, you can apply the `noIcon` prop.
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.NoIcon} />

### Slim Variant
The slim variant is a compact version of the alert, ideal for short descriptions. It removes the header and centers the icon for a cleaner layout.
