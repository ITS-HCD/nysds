# Alert

The **`nys-alert`** component is a reusable web component for use in New York State digital products. It provides users with the ability to keep users informed of important and sometimes time-sensitive changes.

## Examples

### All Alerts
Below are the available alert types, each showcasing its unique style and purpose.
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.AllAlerts} />

### Alert Type
To change the type of alert, use the `type` prop. The example below shows `type="info"`
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.AlertType} />

### Dismissible
Set a `dismissible` boolean property to add a close button in the top-right corner, allowing users to dismiss the alert.
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.Dismissible} />

### Duration
Set the `duration` property to automatically hide the alert after a specified time (in milliseconds). This is ideal for non-critical alerts that do not require user acknowledgment.
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.Duration} />

### Icon Customization
Override the default `type` icon by setting the `icon` property to any name from the icon library.
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.CustomIcon} />

### No Icon Option
To displays an alert without an accompanying icon, you can turn the `noIcon` prop to true.
<Canvas of={NysAlertStories.NoIcon} />

### Slim Variant
The slim variant is a compact version of the alert, ideal for short descriptions. It removes the header and centers the icon for a cleaner layout.
