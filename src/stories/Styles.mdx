# Styling the Excelsior Design System

## Summary
  - A centralized CSS file for core design tokens (excelsior.min.css)
  - Agency-specific theme stylesheets (e.g., theme-health.min.css, theme-environment.min.css) that can override the components and UI elements using themed variables
  - Utility classes the cover common styling needs for grid layout, display styles, flexbox, floats, opacity, and z-index 
  - Integration support for the design system’s code components, which will reference these variables in their Shadow DOM.

## Features

**Global Stylesheet:**

The `excelsior.min.css` file includes foundational design tokens, like spacing, typography, and default theme colors.

To use, reference this on pages where you'll be using the variables or the design system components:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-dir]/excelsior.min.css" />
```

**Agency-Specific Themes:**

Additional theme stylesheets are published that provide agency-specific color tokens:

- **Administration:** `excelsior-theme-admin.min.css`
- **Business:** `excelsior-theme-business.min.css`
- **Recreation and Environment:** `excelsior-theme-environment.min.css`
- **Health and Human Services:** `excelsior-theme-health.min.css`
- **Local and Regional Authorities:** `excelsior-theme-local.min.css`
- **Public Safety:** `excelsior-theme-safety.min.css`
- **Transportation and Utilities:** `excelsior-theme-transportation.min.css`

To override the default theme:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-dir]/excelsior.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-dir]/excelsior-theme-health.min.css" />
```
**Utility classes:**

Excelsior includes a set of utility classes for common styling needs, including grid layout, display styles, flexbox, floats, opacity, and z-index. These classes are designed to be used directly in your HTML to quickly apply common styles without writing custom CSS.

To include the full utility classes, simply include the utility CSS file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-dir]/excelsior-full.min.css" />
```

**Shadow DOM Integration:**

The design system’s web components dynamically reference these tokens using CSS variables within their Shadow DOM. For example:

```css
:host {
  --_nys-button-background-color: var(--nys-button-background-color, var(--nys-color-theme, #0044cc));
}
button {
  background-color: var(--_nys-button-background-color);
}
```

**Theme Variables:**

Each theme includes a predefined set of CSS variables (e.g., --nys-color-theme-faint, --nys-color-theme-stronger) tailored to the agency-specific color palette. These variables are used by components and design elements in the library to give residents a cohesive and branded user experience. Including an agency-specific theme stylesheet will override the default colors, and change these color of the components and elements to reflect the theme for a given agency group. This makes it easy to adapt the design system to align with each agency's branding requirements.
