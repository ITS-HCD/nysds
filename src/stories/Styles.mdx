The Excelsior Design System provides a CSS framework to ensure consistency, flexibility, and accessibility across applications. It is designed to work seamlessly with Excelsior’s web components or as a standalone package for teams using other platforms or frameworks.

## What's Included?

The CSS framework is an collection of stylesheets that provide foundational CSS for tokens, themes, and utilities. The `@nys-excelsior/styles` package includes:
  - **Global Stylesheet:** A centralized CSS file (excelsior.min.css) for core design tokens like colors, typography, and spacing.
  - **Agency-Specific Themes:** Optional CSS files tailored for individual agencies, enabling branding customization via CSS variables.
  - **Utility Classes:** Lightweight, reusable classes for layout, spacing, and display styles.

Excelsior web components reference these CSS variables within the Shadow DOM for their styling.

## Using the CSS Framework

The global stylesheet (`excelsior.min.css`) is the foundation of the Excelsior Design System. It defines core design tokens for colors, typography, and spacing — like `--nys-color-theme`, `--nys-space-200`, and `--nys-font-size-md`. Excelsior's web components need these tokens to display correctly.

For the full token list, see the [Design Tokens page](?path=/docs/design-tokens--docs).

The @styles package is available on npm and can be used in any application, even without Excelsior’s web components. This flexibility means you can use the design system’s tokens, themes, and utilities across different platforms.

### Installing via npm

Install the styles package:

``` bash 
npm install @nys-excelsior/styles
```

After installation, reference the styles in your application:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@nys-excelsior/styles/dist/excelsior.min.css"> 
```

### Manual Download

You can also download the CSS files directly from the styles npm page and include them in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-your-project]/excelsior.min.css">
```

##  Applying Agency-Specific Themes

Excelsior provides theme stylesheets for NYS agency groups in order to to align applications and components design with specific agency branding. These themes override themed design tokens like `--nys-color-theme`.

To use a theme in an application, include a reference to the theme stylesheet after the global stylesheet:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-dir]/excelsior.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-dir]/excelsior-theme-health.min.css">
```

Every Excelsior component or element using one of the themed design tokens will now reflect that agency grouping's branding.

### Available Themes

- Administration: `excelsior-theme-admin.min.css`
- Business: `excelsior-theme-business.min.css`
- Recreation and Environment: `excelsior-theme-environment.min.css`
- Health and Human Services: `excelsior-theme-health.min.css`
- Local and Regional Authorities: `excelsior-theme-local.min.css`
- Public Safety: `excelsior-theme-safety.min.css`
- Transportation and Utilities: `excelsior-theme-transportation.min.css`

## Excelsior Components Integration

Excelsior web components use CSS variables for styling. We reference them within each component's Shadow DOM, allowing global tokens to cascade naturally while preserving encapsulation.

### How CSS Variables Work in Excelsior Components

Excelsior components use CSS variables in two different ways to balance extensibility and encapsulation: public and pseudo-private variables.

Most component properties are set using ["pseudo-private variables"](https://youtu.be/ZuZizqDF4q8?t=711) that are defined within a component’s Shadow DOM and are not meant to be overridden. They take the format `--_[component]-[property]` (note the underscore). Pseudo-variables are internal, but they listen for public variables, which take format `--[component]-[property]` (no underscore), to allow for flexibility and customization for some properties. They fall back to the design systems' default value if the public variable is not set.

For example:

``` css
:host { 
  --_nys-button-background-color: var(--nys-button-background-color, var(--nys-color-theme, #154973;)); 
}
button { 
  background-color: var(--_nys-button-background-color); 
}
```

The button component sets its own background color using a pseudo-private `--_nys-button-background-color` variable. It will use the value of `--nys-button-background-color` if it's defined, or `--nys-color-theme` (our default design system value) if it's not. If neither of those are set, it will default to `#154973`.

To create a button with a custom background color, set the `--nys-button-background-color` variable on the button element:

``` html
<button style="--nys-button-background-color: #990000;">Delete Forever</button>
```

In short, we've created a style API for buttons:

1. If you need to change the background color of a single button, you can set `--nys-button-background-color` on that button.
2. If you don't, the button will use the theme color.
3. If Excelsior variables don't load, the button will default to a hardcoded value.

Public variables are not exposed for all component properties. Be sure to check the component's documentation for which variables are public.

## Utility Classes

Excelsior provides a lightweight utility-focused CSS framework from [the US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/utilities/) to speed up mobile-responsive web development. These classes let you quickly style responsive layouts without writing custom CSS.

Available Utility Categories
- [Layout](?path=/docs/layout-grid--docs): grid-related layout utilities.
- [Flexbox](?path=/docs/flexbox--docs): Layout, alignment, and ordering utilities.
- [Other](?path=/docs/utilities--docs): Display, opacity, elevation, and other miscellaneous utilities.

To enable utility classes, include the full utility stylesheet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-dir]/excelsior-full.min.css">
```
