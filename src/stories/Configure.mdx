# Welcome to the New York State Design System

The New York State Design System (NYSDS) is a design system for New York State government websites. It's a set of reusable web components, design tokens, and utilities to create consistent, mobile-friendly, accessible digital experiences across the state's digital products.

This Storybook serves as a guide for engineers to explore, understand, and implement the NYSDS's components and styles in their applications.

## Quick Start for Developers

⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. The instructions here are for developers who want to evaluate or provide feedback on the NYSDS.

### Install the core libraries in your project:

To start using the NYSDS in your project, you need to install the core libraries:

```
npm install @nysds/components @nysds/styles
```

### Reference the files in your application:

```html
<script type="module" src="[path-to-dir]/nysds.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-dir]/nysds.min.css" />
```

**If you are not using a package manager**, you can download the files directly from the [NYSDS Components NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nysds/components) and [NYSDS Style NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nysds/styles). Keep in mind, you will need to manually update the files when new versions are released.

### Start using NYSDS components in your application:

All that's left is to start using NYSDS components in your application.

``` html
<nys-alert 
  dismissible
  theme="success" 
  heading="Application Submitted" 
  text="Your application has been submitted. You will receive a confirmation email shortly."> 
</nys-alert>
```
Explore the **Components** section in the sidebar to find documentation, usage guidance, and interactive previews for each of the components in the NYSDS.

## About the New York State Design System

Our mission is to standardize and elevate digital experiences across New York State by providing scalable, accessible tools for building applications.

### What’s Included?

- **Components:** Modular web components built with Lit for performance and flexibility.
- **Styles:** A foundational CSS framework, including design tokens and utility classes.
- **Themes:** Customizable agency-specific themes for adapting designs to organizational branding.
- **Figma Libraries:** Design libraries for prototyping that mirror the components and variables in code, promoting consistency between design and development.

## Why Use NYSDS?
