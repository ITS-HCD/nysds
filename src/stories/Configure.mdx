# Welcome to the Excelsior Design System

The Excelsior Design System is a design system for New York State government websites. It's a set of reusable web components, design tokens, and utilities to create consistent, mobile-friendly, accessible digital experiences across the state's digital products.

This Storybook serves as a guide for engineers to explore, understand, and implement Excelsior’s components and styles in their applications.

## Quick Start for Developers

⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. The instructions here are for developers who want to evaluate or provide feedback on the Excelsior Design System.

### Install the core libraries in your project:

To start using Excelsior in your project, you need to install the core libraries:

```
npm install @nys-excelsior/components @nys-excelsior/styles
```

### Reference the files in your application:

```html
<script type="module" src="[path-to-dir]/excelsior.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-dir]/excelsior.min.css" />
```

**If you are not using a package manager**, you can download the files directly from the [Excelsior Components NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nys-excelsior/components) and [Excelsior Style NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nys-excelsior/styles). Keep in mind, you will need to manually update the files when new versions are released.

### Start using Excelsior components in your application:

All that's left is to start using Excelsior components in your application.

``` html
<nys-alert 
  dismissible
  theme="success" 
  heading="Application Submitted" 
  text="Your application has been submitted. You will receive a confirmation email shortly."> 
</nys-alert>
```
Explore the **Components** section in the sidebar to find documentation, usage guidance, and interactive previews for each of the components in the Excelsior Design System.
